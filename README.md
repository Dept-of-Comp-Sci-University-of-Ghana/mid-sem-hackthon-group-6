Underwater Sonar Mine vs Rock Data Classification Project

This project demonstrates the classification of sonar signals using machine learning. It utilizes a VotingClassifier ensemble with Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models to predict whether a sonar signal originates from a rock or a mine.

# Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

To install the dependencies, run:
# Running the Code

1. *Place the dataset:* Ensure the `sonar.all-data.csv` file is in the same directory as the code.
2. *Execute the notebook:* Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file and run all cells.

# Project Structure

- *`sonar_classification.ipynb` (or `.py`):* Contains the main code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- *`test_sonar_classification.py`:* Contains unit tests for the project.

# Running Tests

To run the unit tests, make sure you have pytest installed:
Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
This will execute the tests and provide a report on their status.

# Customization

- *Model Parameters:* Adjust the parameters of the individual models (LogisticRegression, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier) within the VotingClassifier for potential performance improvement.

- *Feature Selection:* Experiment with different feature selection methods or parameters to optimize the feature subset.

- *Cross-Validation:* Modify the number of folds in KFold for more robust evaluation.
