 Sonar Data Classification Project
 This project aims to classify sonar signals as either originating from a rock ("R") or a mine ("M"). 
 The dataset used is the "sonar.all-data.csv" file.
     Steps:
 1. Import Libraries: Necessary libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy are imported.
 2. Load Data: The sonar dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
 3. Data Preprocessing:
    - Shape and summary statistics of the data are examined.
    - Duplicate values and null values are checked for.
 4. Separate Target Variable:
    - Features (X) are separated from the target variable (Y).
    - The target variable is encoded as 1 for "M" (mine) and 0 for "R" (rock).
 5. Feature Selection:
    - RandomForestClassifier is used with SelectFromModel to identify important features.
 6. Feature Scaling:
    - MinMaxScaler is used to scale the features.
 7. Model Definition:
    - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors models are defined.
    - A VotingClassifier ensemble is created using these models with soft voting.
 8. Cross-Validation:
    - 5-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance.
 9. Model Training and Evaluation:
    - The ensemble model is trained and evaluated on each fold.
    - Accuracy and classification report are calculated for each fold.
 10. Results:
     - The mean accuracy and standard deviation across folds are printed.
