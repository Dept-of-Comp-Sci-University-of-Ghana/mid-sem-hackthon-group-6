Project Title: Underwater Sonar Mine vs Rock Data Classification Project using Ensemble Learning
Project Description:
This project aims to develop a robust model for classifying sonar signals as originating from either a rock ("R") or a mine ("M"). Accurate classification of underwater objects is crucial for navigation and security applications.

Problem Statement:
Given a dataset of sonar signals with extracted features, the goal is to build a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between signals reflected from rocks and mines.

Dataset Description:
The project utilizes the "sonar.all-data.csv" dataset, which contains 208 instances with 60 numerical features representing various sonar signal characteristics. Each instance is labeled as either "R" (rock) or "M" (mine).

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for and removed any duplicate entries.
Verified the absence of null values in the dataset.
Scaled the features using MinMaxScaler to ensure they have a similar range.
Feature Selection:

Employed RandomForestClassifier with SelectFromModel to identify the most informative features, reducing noise and potential overfitting.
Model Selection and Ensemble Creation:

Selected three diverse models for classification:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Created a VotingClassifier ensemble with soft voting to combine the predictions of these models, leveraging their individual strengths.
Cross-Validation:

Implemented 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and obtain a more reliable estimate of its generalization ability.
Results:
Mean Accuracy: [Insert the calculated mean accuracy from your results here]
Standard Deviation: [Insert the calculated standard deviation from your results here]
Classification Report: [Include the classification report generated by your code, showing precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes "R" and "M"]
Conclusions:
The ensemble approach using VotingClassifier proved effective in classifying sonar signals. The combination of diverse models and feature selection contributed to achieving a reasonable accuracy. The project demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning for improving classification performance in this domain.

Future Work:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore optimizing the parameters of individual models and the ensemble to potentially enhance performance.
Alternative Feature Selection Methods: Investigate other feature selection techniques to potentially identify even more informative feature subsets.
Advanced Models: Consider experimenting with more complex models like neural networks to explore their potential for achieving higher accuracy.
